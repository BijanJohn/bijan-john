This is my first blog post on my new website!

I'm going to detail a bit about what I learned on my first solo travel trip to Costa Rica.

Some highlights of my **favorite** things I experienced were:

* Speaking Spanish with non English speakers
    Picture of something Spanish related.
* Building connection with new friends at my yoga retreat

* Meeting my mentor Ryan for the first time in person

* Experiencing a slower life (Pura Vida!), cleaner air/water/food and fruit that grows everywhere
