Picture of Light Phone

Ask audience, do you feel you are too addicted to technology and your phone?

Are you curious how you can improve your relationship with this device?

My experiment with using Light Phone.

Thoughts and reflections.

In the end I recently decided to go back to my iPhone because my internet carrier offered me a free year of phone service at no charge.
Unfortunately this provider is not compatible with the Light Phone.
I still found the experience very rewarding and I would recommend it for anyone interested in gaining back their attention.
